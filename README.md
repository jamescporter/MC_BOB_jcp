- Modder: maintained/modified by *James C. Porter*.

### Repository structure
- `BOB_behaviors/` — Behavior Pack
- `BOB_resources/` — Resource Pack

Both packs are required for proper gameplay.

### Version and compatibility

- Add-on version: `1.2.0-0.9`
- Minimum Bedrock engine version: `1.21.110`

### Installation (manual)
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Copy both folders into your Minecraft Bedrock development packs directory:
   - `BOB_behaviors` → behavior packs folder
   - `BOB_resources` → resource packs folder
3. Open/create a world in Minecraft Bedrock.
4. Enable both packs in that world:
   - Behavior Packs: **Better on Bedrock - Behavior Pack**
   - Resource Packs: **Better on Bedrock - Resource Pack**
5. Enter the world.


### Notes
- This repo is a custom/modified distribution and does differ from the upstream release.
- Please keep attribution to the original author when redistributing forks or edits.
- This has basically been vibe-coded as an experiment. I've been going over codex changes with multiple iterations to catch introduced bugs/hallucinations and cross-checking.
- Currently untested.

## Conceptual overview of changes since the initial commit

Since the baseline Better on Bedrock commit, this fork has mainly focused on reliability and performance rather than large gameplay redesigns.

- **Performance and scalability:** per-tick and high-frequency scripts were refactored to reduce repeated work, improve caching, and lower runtime overhead.
- **Bug fixes and hardening:** a broad pass of defensive fixes addressed regressions, malformed data handling, null/unsafe state access, duplicate triggers, and cleanup edge cases.
- **Item/combat system stability:** backpacks, staffs, spear/trident logic, strip-block interactions, and related item systems were made more robust while preserving intended gameplay behaviour.
- **Quest flow resilience:** regular, bounty, and bought-quest paths were tightened with safer parsing/selection logic, better reconciliation, and duplicate-state normalisation.
- **Entity and ambience updates:** Seeker/Inferior and supporting end-mob logic were adjusted, alongside ambient and fog behaviour refinements for more consistent world state transitions.
- **Gameplay balancing and maintenance:** trader values received light balance tuning, and documentation/attribution metadata was cleaned up.

Overall, the project has moved towards a more production-ready implementation of Better on Bedrock: same core identity, but with better runtime behaviour and fewer failure points.
