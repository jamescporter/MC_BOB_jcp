### Notes
- This repo is a custom/modified distribution and does differ from the upstream release.
- Please keep attribution to the original author when redistributing forks or edits.
- This has basically been vibe-coded as an experiment. I've been going over codex changes with multiple iterations to catch introduced bugs/hallucinations and cross-checking.
- Currently untested.

## Overview of changes in this mod:

This fork mainly focuses on reliability and performance.

- **Performance and scalability:** per-tick and high-frequency scripts were refactored to reduce repeated work, improve caching, and lower runtime overhead.
- **Bug fixes and hardening:** Lots of defensive fixes addressung malformed data handling, null/unsafe state access, duplicate triggers, and cleanup edge cases.
- **Item/combat system stability:** backpacks, staffs, spear/trident logic, strip-block interactions, and related item systems were made more robust while preserving existing functionality.
- **Quest flow:** regular, bounty, and bought-quest paths were tightened with safer parsing/selection logic, better reconciliation, and duplicate-state normalisation.
- **Entity and ambience updates:** Seeker/Inferior and supporting end-mob logic were adjusted, alongside ambient and fog behaviour refinements for more consistent world state transitions.
- **Goblin Trader balance:** trader values received light balance tuning so he's not as OP.
- **Fire Wisps size:** Fire Wisps now have a ~33% larger custom hitbox and a slight scale increase, making them less frustrating to hit without changing their core behaviour.
- **Bassalt Crobbers:** Bassalt Crobbers now prioritise targeting and attack goals above idle wandering to improve combat responsiveness. Updated delayed attack path requirements (`require_complete_path: false`) and added conservative Nether navigation flags (`can_path_over_water: false`, `avoid_damage_blocks: true`) while keeping existing water avoidance and attack timing/damage unchanged.
- **JSON validity hotfix (Piglin behaviour):** Fixed an invalid inline comment in `BOB_behaviors/entities/nether_mobs/piglin.json` that broke JSON parsing, and completed `broadcast_targets` with both `"piglin"` and `"piglin_brute"` as originally intended.
